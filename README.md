# Modal
This project is a simple click outside modal that I've created using JavaScript.

The modal is triggered by clicking on a button within a card element. When the button is clicked, the modal is displayed and the card's title, image, and description are displayed within the modal.

The modal can be closed by either clicking outside of the modal or pressing the Escape key. The modal also has a close button that can be used to close it.

This project demonstrates the use of event listeners and DOM manipulation to create a dynamic and user-friendly experience.
