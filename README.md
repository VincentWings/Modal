# Modal  

[View the Modal](https://vincentwings.github.io/Modal/)  

This project features a simple **click outside modal** created using vanilla JavaScript. The modal is designed to enhance user interaction by displaying additional content when triggered by a button within a card element.

## Features  

- **Card-Based Trigger**: The modal is activated by clicking a button within a card, displaying the card's title, image, and description inside the modal.  
- **Click Outside to Close**: The modal can be closed by clicking outside the modal area.  
- **Escape Key Functionality**: Users can also close the modal by pressing the Escape key, providing a quick and intuitive way to exit.  
- **Event Listeners & DOM Manipulation**: This project demonstrates the use of event listeners and DOM manipulation to toggle the visibility of the modal and manage user interactions.  

## Technologies Used  

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure of the modal and card elements.  
- **CSS3**: Styles the modal and card layout, including transitions for a smooth opening and closing effect.  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Implements event listeners for triggering and closing the modal, as well as DOM manipulation to update content dynamically.  

## How It Works  

1. A button within the card element triggers the modal when clicked, displaying the content (title, image, and description) inside the modal.  
2. The modal is styled and displayed using CSS for a smooth transition effect.  
3. The modal can be closed by clicking anywhere outside of the modal area or pressing the Escape key, triggering the event listeners associated with those actions.  
4. JavaScript handles the toggling of modal visibility and updates the content dynamically based on the clicked card.

## Skills Demonstrated  

- **JavaScript Event Handling**: Using event listeners for click and keyboard actions.  
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically altering content and visibility of elements based on user interaction.  
- **User Experience (UX)**: Providing a smooth and responsive interaction with the modal, ensuring ease of use.  

This project demonstrates how to implement a dynamic and user-friendly modal experience using vanilla JavaScript and basic web technologies. ðŸšªâœ¨
